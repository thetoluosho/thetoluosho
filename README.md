### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hey there! I'm Toluwalashe Osho

I am a transitioning lawyer diving headfirst into the world of front-end development. 
I am proficient in HTML and CSS and hungry to soak up more knowledge about building beautiful, functional web interfaces. 
Let's code something incredible together! 

Ask me anything!
